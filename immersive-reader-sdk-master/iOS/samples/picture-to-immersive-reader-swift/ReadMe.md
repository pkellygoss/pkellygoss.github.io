Follow the instructions at https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/immersive-reader/azure-active-directory-authentication to create an Immersive Reader resource with a custom subdomain and configure Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication in your Azure tenant. You will need some of the values created here when configuring the sample project properties. Save the output of your session into a text file for future reference.

2. Open terminal and navigate to the iOS-SDK/samples/picture-to-immersive-reader-swift directory. Run the following command: `pod install`.
3. In finder open the Immersive Reader repo cloned and navigate to iOS-SDK/samples/picture-to-immersive-reader-swift and open the picture-to-immersive-reader-swift.xcworkspace file that was just generated by the previous step.
4. In the main project folder, open the file called Constants.swift. Replace the contents with the following code, supplying your custom property values from step one. Keep this file as a local file that only exists on your machine and be sure not to commit this file into source control, as it contains secrets that should not be made public.
```swift
import Foundation

public struct Constants {
    static let tenantId: String = YOUR_TENANT_ID
    static let clientId: String = YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    static let clientSecret: String = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    static let subdomain: String = YOUR_SUBDOMAIN

    static let computerVisionSubscriptionKey: String = YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY
    static let computerVisionEndPoint: String = YOU_ENDPOINT
}
```
4. Set the archive scheme in Xcode by selecting a simulator or device target.
5. In Xcode press Ctrl + R to run the project and the app should launch on the specified simulator or device. Inside the app, take or upload a photo of text by pressing the 'Take Photo' button or 'Choose Photo from Library' button and the Immersive Reader will then launch displaying the text from the photo.
