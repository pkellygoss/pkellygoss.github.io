# Cognitive Services - Immersive Reader JavaScript SDK (preview)

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/ms/immersive-reader-sdk/_apis/build/status/96)](https://dev.azure.com/ms/immersive-reader-sdk/_build?definitionId=96)

The Immersive Reader JavaScript SDK is a JavaScript library that allows you to easily and quickly integrate the [Immersive Reader](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/immersive-reader/) into your web application.

## Usage

Usage of this SDK requires an Azure subscription to Immersive Reader. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/immersive-reader/azure-active-directory-authentication) to create an Immersive Reader resource with a custom subdomain and configure Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication in your Azure tenant.

Once you have completed that configuration, you will have a subdomain and will be able to create an Azure AD authentication token. Both the subdomain and a token are required when calling the SDK to launch the Immersive Reader.

You can find examples of how to acquire an Azure AD token in the [samples](./samples).

Include the library of the stable build in your web application:

```html
<script type='text/javascript' src='https://contentstorage.onenote.office.net/onenoteltir/immersivereadersdk/immersive-reader-sdk.0.0.3.js'></script>
```

```bash
npm install @microsoft/immersive-reader-sdk
```

```bash
yarn add @microsoft/immersive-reader-sdk
```

Add an HTML element to your webpage with the `immersive-reader-button` class attribute.

```html
<div class='immersive-reader-button' onclick='launchImmersiveReader()'></div>
```

Next, invoke the Immersive Reader when the button is clicked:

```typescript
function launchImmersiveReader() {
    const content = {
        title: 'Immersive Reader',
        chunks: [ {
            content: 'Hello, world!'
        } ]
    };
    ImmersiveReader.launchAsync(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR_SUBDOMAIN, content);
}
```

Take a look at the [samples](./samples) for examples of a full end-to-end integration.
